# Hello World 👋

I am a Ukrainian software engineer. Feel free to explore my popular repos pinned below.

Currently in progress:

* [TODO-API](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/TODO-API) - API for allowing users to manage their TODO lists. Currently working on system design and database schemas.

Recently completed:

* [video2mp3](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/video2mp3) - back-end microservice written in Python which converts videos (.mp4, .mkv, etc.) into the respective mp3 audio files extracted from the videos.
* [Market](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/Market) - a website built using Flask and sqlite3 to showcase authentication and storing items for sale in a small database.
* [GitHub User Activity](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/Git-Activity) - a simple CLI to fetch any GitHub user recent activity and display it in a terminal 🧑‍💻
