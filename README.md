# Hello 👋

I am a Ukrainian software engineer from the US. Feel free to explore my popular repos pinned below.

Current projects in progress:

* [Market](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/Market) - a website built using Flask and sqllite3 to showcase authentication and storing items for sale in a small database.
* [FastPy](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/FastPy) - online service built using Fast API. Design is in progress 🧑‍🍳 

Recently completed:

* [video2mp3](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/video2mp3) - back-end microservice written in Python which converts videos (.mp4, .mkv, etc.) into the respective mp3 audio files extracted from the videos.
